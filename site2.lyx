\begin_layout Standard
OpenUDC is a set of free softwares designed to create a free money system
 based on a decentralized human P2P network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The softwares are under <a title="WikiPedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AG
PL">AGPL</a> et <a title="WikiPedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGPL">LGPL

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Free Money system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The OpenUDC softwares are designed to manage a free money system as described
 by the TRM (Th√©orie Relative de la Monnaie), that means a money system
 where no human has privileges in front of money creation either in time
 or in space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These money systems solutions are Universal Dividend based money systems.
 Every member in the community create (equal to receive) the same Universal
 Dividend per period of time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OpenUDC development chosen rule is described in the FAQ.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OpenUDC allow each community who want to use its own free money to describe
 its own Universal Dividend set of rules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Human P2P network
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
$coment=sprintf(_("A web of trust in a human community"));
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
get_image("graph/mens","svg","80%",$coment );
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The OpenUDC human P2P network is based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op
enPGP">OpenPGP</a>.
 There is an OpenPGP Web of Trust which identify the members of one OpenUDC
 community sharing the same free money.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A new member entering the money system has to be signed by a determined
 (parameter of the money system) number of existing members.
 A member yet existing in the money system has to renew periodically signing
 in a period of time (other parameter of the money system), as a renewable
 proof of life.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So there is no center, no centralized organism in an OpenUDC money system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Exchanges
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exchanges are made directly from person to person in "digital coins".
 The sender announce to the system the amount and the receiver, he signs
 it, and then send it to one node.
 The node makes a propagation of the information, and when the whole system
 fully validate the transaction, the receiver has the information.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
OpenUDC nodes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A node is an instance of OpenUDC software, connected to other nodes.
 All those P2P connected nodes know the OpenUDC Web of Trust, and share
 the same database in a synchronized way.
 So the database itself is a P2P shared database containing the whole Monetary
 Mass.
 So each member of an OpenUDC money system can have its own node and own
 copy of the updated OpenUDC Web of Trust and OpenUDC Monetary Mass.

Technical choices 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Digital coins 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each digital coin is identified in an unique way.
 It contains the information of it's date of creation, creation owner (the
 member who was the base of that unit creation), and of course the up-to-date
 owner of that coin.
 These digital coins are technically available in different sizes as powers
 of 2 : 2^0, or 2^1, or 2^2, 2^3 etc...
 This choice is due to optimization of memory space, and also due to growing
 quantitative monetary mass.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note1 : OpenUDC system has to show always the information on a relative
 units, so quantitative units can be seen only for technical base.
 On its own account a member has a number a quantitative units Q, he can
 count on number of Universal Dividend making the calculation account :
 Q / UD.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In relative units the monetary Mass don't grow in number of UD units, there
 is always a maximum average of 1 / c Universal Dividend per member, so
 in the relative unit UD there is not really monetary growth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note2 : The OpenUDC digital coins are all in the P2P shared database, and
 so there is no possibility for those coins to be lost (you could lose your
 private OpenUDC Web of Trust Key, but that problem can be solved by other
 ways than the OpenUDC system itself).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Accounts are "keys"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To obtain an account, it is enough to create it, and then to be signed by
 a determined number of existing members.
 Account will be activated only when the system rules will be fully OK.
 Practically you create an OpenUDC WoT private key, and an OpenUDC WoT public
 key, associated with a specific OpenUDC information named UDID2 information.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With those keys you can access to transactions of your own account, send
 to or receive from others.
 You sign and encrypt a "digital order" to send, and then the node recognise
 you, and make the job.
 When it's fully OK, the receiver has the complete information and some
 digital coins have change of owner.
 Work of the nodes When a node receive an encrypted "digital order" it recognise
d the sender, and he is able to decrypt it and work on it.
 The node makes verifications that the sender is the owner of each digital
 coins of the digital order.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Communication between nodes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a node collect a transaction, it informs immediately two other nodes.
 Then these others nodes inform two other nodes and so on.
 It's an exponential speed.
 Each node know before the nodes it has to inform.
 When a new node connect or disconnect to the system, new communication
 rules are automatically calculated.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Create a OpenPGP key with the Open-UDC command line client.
 Also you can use "gpg" with a special <a href ="http://node1.openudc.org:11371/ud
id2/" >OpenUDC UDID2</a>.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Your key must be signed by 5 or more known yet registered users within the
 community (at least enough to be valid with GnuPG's default criteria)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You learn to use LUD or GLUD client to connect to a LUDD node.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You are in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
What mean M, N, c in OpenUDC concepts ?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
M or M(t) means the whole monetary Mass, the sum of all unit coins within
 the community at the date "t".
 N or N(t) mean the total of registered users inside the community at the
 date "t".
 The parameter "c" is used as the &#37; of monetary mass growth per time
 unit (ex : &#37; per year or &#37; per month).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
What are LUD, GLUD, LUDD, UDID2 ?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
LUDD is the free software that run an OpenUDC P2P node.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
LUD is the free software OpenUDC standard command line client.
 LUD means "LUD Universal Dividend" able to connect to a LUDD node.
 You must install LUD on your own machine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
GLUD is a graphical web interface for LUD with a development version here
 : http://node1.openudc.org:11371/udid2/ 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
UDID2 is OpenUDC information needed to add to OpenPGP keys to become candidate
 to OpenUDC PGP keys.
 (see more information in technical specifications for developers).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
What are the rules of OpenUDC Universal Dividend creation ?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rules (for the development standard) are defined as a time function
 UD(t), defined following Relative Money Theory (TRM in french) as a differentia
l dividend : The quantitative dividend must change with only differential
 (small) adds, reaching in relative amount "c" for the average long term
 growth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
UD(0) = 100 Q 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
UD(t+1) = MAX [UD(t) ; c*M(t)/N(t)]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where "t" is the past month.
 UD(t) is the UD of past month.
 "c" is the minimal &#37; UD growth as defined in the 4th rule.
 M(t) is the existing monetary mass, and N(t) is the total amount of members.
 All are values just before calculation of new monthly UD(t+1):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
c = ln(ev:2) / (ev:2)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
c is defined here as the quantitative average monetary mass growth based
 on human average life expectancy.
 For a 80 years average life expectancy we have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
c = ln(40) / 40 = 9&#37; / year.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As those rules are parameters of OpenUDC, one community can use OpenUDC
 with other set of rules.
 OpenUDC is totally independant of the rules chosen by a money community.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Why OpenUDC contributors say "there is no inflation" since we have a Monetary
 growth ?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because inflation is a false conclusion due to ignorance relatively to a
 bad unit of money because the Quantative units of money growth due to Universal
 Dividend is not the Relative one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An OpenUDC community use the relative unit 1 UD, and not the quantitative
 1 Q.
 So there is still in the money system the same number of money units N
 / c UD.
 And then the number of UD money units only depend of the number of members,
 and the average amount of money per member is always fixed or limited by
 1 / c UD.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So inflation is not a problem in Universal Dividend money system, because
 there is Quantitative creation but not Relative money creation and we count
 in number of Universal Dividend, the Relative Unit.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inflation is only a problem in non-free money system when some individuals
 create money for their own benefit and to the detriment of others, and
 so the problem is due to that non-free money model.
\end_layout

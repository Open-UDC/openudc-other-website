How-to translate
-------------

To translate we are using Transifex :

[https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/openudc-other-website](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/openudc-other-website)

Translate is quick and really useful for use. You just need:

1. to subscribe as translator on transifex  [https://www.transifex.com/signup/contributor/](https://www.transifex.com/signup/contributor/)
2. to ask to join team for each project and each language. For example, go on [https://github.com/Open-UDC/openudc-other-website/blob/master/graph/script/lang/fr](https://github.com/Open-UDC/openudc-other-website/blob/master/graph/script/lang/fr)
, and click on "Join Team" (only if you want).


Modify content
-------------
We use a LyX file to edit the website content. LyX is used to give a more friendly interface than a direct php/gettext edit. A program converts this file for the web engine integration.

WARNING, all translations are based on this text.

- a modification may lead to LOSS of translations;
- for incrementation, no problem.

There are different ways to change the content:

1. Fork on github, modify and submit an issue (follow instructions from ear: [https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo))
2. Download the LyX file: ``wget https://raw.github.com/Open-UDC/openudc-other-website/master/site.lyx``. Modify and send file or link to openz  _AT_ laposte.net
